Testing MagicSwitchBot devices library

IMPORTANT: hcitool and python is not allowed to access bluetooth stack unless the user is root
          To solve it (unsecure):
          
            sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
            sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+eip' $(readlink -f $(which python3))
            sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw+ep' $(readlink -f $(which hcitool))
